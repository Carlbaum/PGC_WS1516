# PGC_WS1516

Optional labs in the course 'Game Physics' at Technische Universität München (TUM).
The topics involve mass-spring systems, simulation and collisions of rigid bodies and fluid simulaiton using a simple SPH algorithm.

Done in Visual Studio 2012. The professor provided us with a program with some already implemented functionality for window handling etc.
